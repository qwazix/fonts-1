Free Open Source Fonts
=========================================

This started as my collection of free fonts that I continually use in my work, and I wanted to be able to easily sync them between my computers. I thought it might be useful to others, so here they are.

Clone into your ~/.local/share/fonts or ~/Library/Fonts directory

I have tried to be very thorough with checking each license before including it here, but I might have missed something, if I'm accidentally infringing on any copyrights, just drop me a message and I will remove non-free fonts immediately

List of fonts
---------------

These fonts may or may not be included in the repository

###Sans Serif

- **[Gidole, by Andreas Larsen](https://github.com/gidole/sans)** â€” a geometric sans, along the lines of DIN. Currently in progress but available for download and usage. OFL license.

Appendix
--------

LibreOffice has a bug that results in extra weights getting lost between Mac and Windows computers. I have modified Source Sans Pro and added duplicate ttf files in order to work around this bug.
